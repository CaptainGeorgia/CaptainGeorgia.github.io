  <h2><i class="fas fa-user-graduate"></i> Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    I discovered my passion for information systems when I realized how technology can transform 
    the way businesses operate and people connect. I'm fascinated by the intersection of 
    technical skills and business strategy, and I enjoy building solutions that are both 
    functional and user-friendly.
  </p>
  <p>
    My goal is to become a skilled technologist who can bridge the gap between complex technical implementations and strategic business objectives. Drawing from my success in international Informatics olympiads and my education at ADA University, I'm particularly interested in algorithm optimization, software architecture, and developing efficient systems. I believe that the best solutions emerge when technical excellence meets clear communication and user-centered thinking. Beyond writing code, I'm passionate about mentoring others, as demonstrated through my work teaching computer science fundamentals to young learners. I hope to contribute to projects that use computational thinking and innovative technology to make a positive impact on communities and industries.
